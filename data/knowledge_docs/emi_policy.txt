EMI Policy Guidelines

Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) consists of both principal and interest components.

The EMI amount is calculated using the amortization formula based on:
- Loan principal
- Interest rate
- Loan tenure

Each EMI payment reduces the outstanding principal amount.

Late EMI payments may result in penalties as per loan agreement terms.

Customers should refer to official EMI calculators for exact figures.
